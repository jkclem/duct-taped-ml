In this repository, I am implementing common machine learning algorithms using only numpy as an educational exercise. 

In addition, I will explain each algorithm and give a demonstration of it inside a Jupyter Notebook in the **test** folder in each folder.

Once it is more fully developed, I will turn it into a package and upload it to PyPI.

## Completed 
* PCA

## In Progress
* KNN Regresser and Classifier

## Future Functionality
* K-Means Clustering
* Linear Regression (OLS and LAD)
* Regularized Linear Regression (LASSO and Ridge)
* Logistic Regression
* Bagging Regresser and Classifier
* Gradient Boosting Regresser and Classifier
* Discriminant Analysis (LDA and QDA)
* Classification and Regression Trees
* K-Folds Cross-Validation
