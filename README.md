# duct-taped-ml

In this repository, I am implementing common machine learning algorithms using only numpy as an educational exercise. 

In addition, I will explain each algorithm and give a demonstration of it inside a Jupyter Notebook in the **test** folder in each folder.

Once it is more fully developed, I will turn it into a package and upload it to PyPI.
